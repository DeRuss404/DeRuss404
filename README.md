### Personal Statement Snippet

I am a computing science graduate and a programming hobbyist adept in object-oriented programming and web-based development.

I am motivated by my curiosity to problem solve while learning new skills and unfamiliar technologies.

I have experience working closely in teams from when I participated in Rookie Oven Academy to produce and present a mock concept food app before an investor during high school, including experience from higher education assignments and work.

For my honours degree, I self-learned Tensorflow and Tensorflowâ€™s Object Detection API to train a selection of object detecting models to automate moderation of uploaded user content.
